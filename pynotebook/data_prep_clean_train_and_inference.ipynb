(keep in mind that zubsolv contains both buprenorphine and naloxone.) using this type of drug instead of zubsolv helps to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms during the induction phase.\\nmaintenance phase\\nafter you safely complete the induction phase, you’ll begin the maintenance phase of zubsolv treatment.\\nduring this phase, you’ll take the lowest zubsolv dosage that prevents opioid withdrawal symptoms and helps you safely progress with treatment. how long maintenance treatment lasts depends on how you’re doing with treatment. your doctor will discuss with you a recommended length of time for zubsolv treatment.\\ntaking zubsolv with other therapies\\nduring treatment with zubsolv, your doctor will recommend other therapies to help support your treatment progress. these other therapies may include:\\nbehavioral therapy, such as counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy\\nsupport groups\\nrecovery apps\\nquestions about zubsolv’s dosing\\nbelow are some common questions about zubsolv’s dosing.\\nwhat if i miss a dose of zubsolv? to avoid side effects, such as opioid withdrawal symptoms, it’s important to take zubsolv exactly as it’s prescribed for you. if you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. but if it’s close to your next regular dose, just skip the missed dose. don’t take two doses of zubsolv at once. doing so can increase your risk for side effects.\\nwill i need to use zubsolv long term? maybe. how long you’ll need to take zubsolv depends on how you’re doing with the treatment. your doctor and counselor will monitor your progress and discuss your treatment goals with you on a regular basis. your treatment will be individually tailored to help you have long-term success. ask your doctor and therapist about the benefits and risks of long-term zubsolv use.\\nhow long does zubsolv take to work? zubsolv starts to work to help curb opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms soon after you take a dose. your doctor will explain the phases of zubsolv treatment so you’ll know what to expect during each phase.\\nis there a best time of day to take zubsolv? there’s no specific time of day that’s best to take zubsolv. but taking this drug around the same time each day helps to keep a steady level of the drug in your body. this helps zubsolv work effectively.    26\n",

(with dependence, your body needs a drug in order for you to feel normal. and with addiction, a drug is taken, even if it’s causing harmful outcomes.)\\nzubsolv is a partial agonist-antagonist drug. this means it provides some similar effects as opioids and it also blocks the effects of opioids.\\nzubsolv contains these two drugs, which help manage opioid dependence symptoms:\\nbuprenorphine, which is a weak opioid. it works to reduce your opioid cravings and lower your risk for opioid withdrawal symptoms after you stop taking opioids.\\nnaloxone, which is an opioid antagonist. it works to block the effects of opioids in your body. this helps prevent misuse of zubsolv, which means you take it in a way other than how it’s prescribed for you. for example, if you crush zubsolv tablets rather than taking them whole as directed, naloxone is released. naloxone blocks the effects of buprenorphine, leading to opioid withdrawal symptoms.\\nyou’ll start zubsolv treatment with an induction phase, which typically lasts for 3 days. this phase lets your body become used to zubsolv. after this phase, your doctor will adjust your zubsolv dosing for the remainder of treatment, which is called the maintenance phase. for more information, see the “how is zubsolv taken?” section above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                26\n",

              "what is zubsolv’s dosage?\\nyour doctor will recommend the dosage of zubsolv that’s right for you. below are commonly used dosages, but always take the dosage your doctor prescribes.\\nform and strengths\\nzubsolv comes as tablets that dissolve when you place them under your tongue.\\nthis medication contains two active drugs: buprenorphine and naloxone. it’s available in six strengths:\\nbuprenorphine 0.7 milligrams (mg) and naloxone 0.18 mg\\nbuprenorphine 1.4 mg and naloxone 0.36 mg\\nbuprenorphine 2.9 mg and naloxone 0.71 mg\\nbuprenorphine 5.7 mg and naloxone 1.4 mg\\nbuprenorphine 8.6 mg and naloxone 2.1 mg\\nbuprenorphine 11.4 mg and naloxone 2.9 mg\\nrecommended dosages\\nthe dosage of zubsolv your doctor prescribes for you will depend on:\\nhow severe your condition is\\nwhich type of opioids (either short-acting or long-acting) you were taking\\nany other medications you’re taking\\nwhether you’re switching to zubsolv from another treatment medication\\nzubsolv treatment phases\\ntreatment with zubsolv involves two phases:\\ninduction (the beginning phase of treatment)\\nmaintenance (the continuation phase of treatment)\\ninduction phase\\nduring the induction phase, your zubsolv dosage is managed so that you don’t experience opioid withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts to zubsolv. your doctor will monitor your treatment progress carefully during this phase.\\nthe induction phase typically lasts for 3 days. but your doctor will determine how long your induction phase should last depending on your unique situation.\\nsometimes, a medication other than zubsolv is used for the induction phase. in this case, a drug that only contains buprenorphine is typically used. (keep in mind that zubsolv contains both buprenorphine and naloxone.) using this type of drug instead of zubsolv helps to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms during the induction phase.\\nmaintenance phase\\nafter you safely complete the induction phase, you’ll begin the maintenance phase of zubsolv treatment.\\nduring this phase, you’ll take the lowest zubsolv dosage that prevents opioid withdrawal symptoms and helps you safely progress with treatment. how long maintenance treatment lasts depends on how you’re doing with treatment. your doctor will discuss with you a recommended length of time for zubsolv treatment.\\ntaking zubsolv with other therapies\\nduring treatment with zubsolv, your doctor will recommend other therapies to help support your treatment progress. these other therapies may include:\\nbehavioral therapy, such as counseling or cognitive behavioral therapy\\nsupport groups\\nrecovery apps\\nquestions about zubsolv’s dosing\\nbelow are some common questions about zubsolv’s dosing.\\nwhat if i miss a dose of zubsolv? to avoid side effects, such as opioid withdrawal symptoms, it’s important to take zubsolv exactly as it’s prescribed for you. if you miss a dose, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. but if it’s close to your next regular dose, just skip the missed dose. don’t take two doses of zubsolv at once. doing so can increase your risk for side effects.\\nwill i need to use zubsolv long term? maybe. how long you’ll need to take zubsolv depends on how you’re doing with the treatment. your doctor and counselor will monitor your progress and discuss your treatment goals with you on a regular basis. your treatment will be individually tailored to help you have long-term success. ask your doctor and therapist about the benefits and risks of long-term zubsolv use.\\nhow long does zubsolv take to work? zubsolv starts to work to help curb opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms soon after you take a dose. your doctor will explain the phases of zubsolv treatment so you’ll know what to expect during each phase.\\nis there a best time of day to take zubsolv? there’s no specific time of day that’s best to take zubsolv. but taking this drug around the same time each day helps to keep a steady level of the drug in your body. this helps zubsolv work effectively.    26\n",

              "what are injectafer’s side effects?\\nlike most drugs, injectafer may cause mild or serious side effects. the lists below describe some of the more common side effects that injectafer may cause. these lists don’t include all possible side effects.\\nkeep in mind that side effects of a drug can depend on:\\nyour age\\nother health conditions you have\\nother medications you may be taking\\nyour doctor or pharmacist can tell you more about the potential side effects of injectafer. they can also suggest ways to help reduce side effects.\\nmild side effects\\nhere’s a short list of some of the mild side effects that injectafer can cause. to learn about other mild side effects, talk with your doctor or pharmacist, or read injectafer’s prescribing information.\\nmild side effects of injectafer that have been reported include:\\nnausea\\nhigh blood pressure\\nflushing (temporary warmth, redness, or deepening of skin color)\\ndizziness\\nlow phosphorus level that doesn’t cause symptoms\\ninfusion-related or injection-related side effects*\\ndiarrhea*\\nmild side effects of many drugs may go away within a few days or a couple of weeks. but if they become bothersome, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.\\n* for more information on this side effect, see the “side effect focus” section below.\\nserious side effects\\nserious side effects from injectafer can occur, but they aren’t common. if you have serious side effects from injectafer, call your doctor right away. but if you think you’re having a medical emergency, you should call 911 or your local emergency number.\\nserious side effects* of injectafer that have been reported include:\\nlow phosphorus level that causes symptoms\\nallergic reaction, including delayed allergic reaction\\n* for more information on these side effects, see the “side effect focus” section below.\\nside effect focus\\nlearn more about some of the side effects injectafer may cause.\\nlow phosphorus levels\\ninjectafer may lower the level of phosphorus in your blood. this condition is also called hypophosphatemia.\\nyour risk for this side effect may be increased if:\\nyou’re already at risk for low phosphorus levels, or\\nyou require more than one dose of treatment with injectafer\\nrisk factors for having a low phosphorus level include:\\nhistory of digestive system issues\\nuse of medications that affect your kidney function\\nhigh level of parathyroid hormone\\nlow levels of vitamin d\\nmalnutrition\\nmost people won’t have any symptoms of low phosphorus level. but if you’re already at risk for having a low phosphorus level, you may develop symptoms. these symptoms can include fatigue (lack of energy), muscle weakness, loss of appetite, and bone pain or fractures.\\nalthough rare, if your phosphorus level drops too low, you may develop complications. these can include:\\nrhabdomyolysis (a type of muscle tissue death)\\ntrouble breathing\\na type of anemia (low red blood cell level) that’s caused by your red blood cells dying more quickly than usual\\nirregular heartbeat\\nwhat might help\\nif you need to take injectafer and you’re at risk for hypophosphatemia, your doctor will check your phosphorus levels. they’ll recommend whether it’s safe for you to receive this drug.\\nif you have any symptoms of low phosphorus level, tell your doctor right away. but if your symptoms feel life threatening, call 911 or your local emergency number.\\ninfusion-related or injection-related side effects\\nwhen you’re receiving injectafer, you might develop injection site reactions where the drug is injected or infused into your body.\\ninfusion-related or injection-related side effects are skin reactions that include:\\nchanges in the color of your skin where the drug is injected\\nfluid leaking from the injection site\\npain at the injection site\\nchanges in skin color may last several months after a drug infusion. and sometimes, they can cause cosmetic concerns.\\nwhat might help\\nyour doctor can help prevent or reduce the risk of skin discoloration with injectafer injections.\\nto help prevent this side effect, they can rinse the infusion tubing with a salt solution before removing the needle from your skin. this will stop injectafer from leaking into the tissues under your skin around the injection site.\\nif you have concerns about side effects related to injectafer infusions or injections, talk with your doctor.\\ndiarrhea\\ndiarrhea isn’t a common side effect of injectafer. compared to other forms of iron that are given by injection, the rates of diarrhea are similar with injectafer.\\ndiarrhea may occur more often with iron replacement products that you take by mouth than it does with injectafer.\\nwhat might help\\nif you get diarrhea with injectafer, talk with your doctor. they may recommend over-the-counter medications to help relieve diarrhea. but be sure to talk with your doctor before taking any drugs to stop diarrhea.\\nif you have long-lasting kidney disease, you must avoid dehydration (low fluid level), which can happen with diarrhea. this is because dehydration can be very serious for people with kidney problems.\\nrehydration is the first step to managing diarrhea. to replace your fluid and electrolyte losses from diarrhea, you may need to drink a rehydration solution. these rehydration solutions contain a mixture of salt, sugar, and water.\\nyou can also manage diarrhea by eating foods such as bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. it’s also helpful to avoid certain foods, such as dairy products, if you have diarrhea.\\nallergic reaction\\nsome people may have an allergic reaction to injectafer.\\nsymptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include:\\nrash\\nhives\\nitchiness\\nflushing (temporary warmth, redness, or deepening of skin color)\\na more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include swelling under your skin, typically in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet. they can also include swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat, which can cause trouble breathing or wheezing.\\nif you’re having an allergic reaction to injectafer, you may also have very low blood pressure.\\nwith a severe allergy to injectafer, you may experience:\\nanaphylactic shock\\nvery low blood pressure\\nloss of consciousness\\ncall your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction to injectafer. but if you think you’re having a medical emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number.\\nyour doctor will monitor you for at least 30 minutes after giving injectafer to you. most allergic reactions occur within minutes to a few hours after receiving this drug.\\nrarely, medications can cause delayed allergic reactions. with a delayed allergic reaction, your body reacts to a drug after you’ve received it in the past without having a reaction.\\nfor example, you can develop an allergic reaction with a second dose of injectafer.\\ndelayed allergic reaction was reported after a second dose of ferric carboxymaltose given to a person. (ferric carboxymaltose is the active drug in injectafer.) in this case, the person received two different brand-name medications of ferric carboxymaltose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              26\n",

            "       'What indications is Xgeva used for?\\nXgeva has several indications, which are listed below. (Indications are the specific uses or conditions for which a medication is taken.)\\nXgeva is used in certain adults to:\\nprevent bone fractures in people with multiple myeloma or cancer that has spread to the bones from a solid tumor\\ntreat hypercalcemia (high calcium levels in the blood) due to cancer\\ntreat giant cell tumors (a rare type of bone tumor) that can’t be safely removed by surgery (Xgeva may also be used in certain children with this condition)\\nThese uses are described in more detail below.\\nXgeva for preventing fractures in people with cancer\\nXgeva is used to prevent bone fractures in adults who have one of the following forms of cancer:\\nmultiple myeloma, a cancer that affects the bone marrow\\ncancer that has spread to the bones (also called bone metastases) from a solid tumor. A few examples of solid tumors are prostate cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer.\\nYour body naturally maintains your bones by continually breaking down bone tissue, then rebuilding it. With multiple myeloma or bone metastases, the cancer can interfere with the body’s natural bone maintenance. This may cause bones to break down more quickly than usual. This, along with the effects of certain cancer treatments such as radiation, can lead to weak bones. Weak bones are more likely to fracture (break).\\nXgeva works to prevent bone fractures by slowing bone breakdown. When the drug attaches to a specific protein in your body, it stops certain bone cells from breaking down bone tissue. This helps strengthen your bones.\\nXgeva for hypercalcemia\\nXgeva is also used in certain adults to treat hypercalcemia due to cancer. For this use, doctors prescribe Xgeva for adults who have already tried a bisphosphonate drug, but it didn’t work effectively. Examples of bisphosphonates are alendronate (Fosamax), pamidronate (Aredia), and zoledronic acid (Zometa).\\nSome people with cancer may have high calcium levels. This is because cancer can cause your bones to break down more quickly than usual. When bones break down, calcium is released into the blood. Xgeva works to treat high calcium levels by slowing bone breakdown.\\nXgeva for giant cell tumors\\nXgeva is also used in adults and some children to treat giant cell tumors that can’t be safely removed by surgery. A giant cell tumor is a rare type of bone tumor that’s usually benign (noncancerous). When used in children, doctors typically prescribe Xgeva only to older children whose bones have stopped growing. This generally happens around 12 years of age.\\nXgeva works to treat giant cell tumors by attaching to certain proteins within the tumors. This can help prevent the tumors from growing. This may also help shrink the tumors.',\n",
            "       'What is Abilify used for?\\nIf you have a certain mood disorder or other mental health condition, your doctor may prescribe Abilify for you.\\nIt’s a prescription drug that’s used in people with the following conditions:\\nDepression. Abilify is used to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), which is also called clinical depression. Abilify is prescribed for this purpose in adults. With MDD, you have symptoms of depression almost every day for at least 2 weeks. Symptoms of depression can include:\\nloss of interest in activities you once enjoyed\\nloss of appetite\\ntrouble concentrating\\nmood changes\\ntrouble sleeping\\nweight changes\\nBipolar disorder. Abilify is used to treat manic and mixed episodes related to bipolar I disorder. For this use, Abilify is prescribed for adults and for children ages 10 years and older. Bipolar disorder causes extreme shifts in mood. These shifts usually alternate between episodes of depression and mania (periods of high energy and excitement). Bipolar I disorder is diagnosed after at least one episode of mania has occurred. With mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, you may have:\\nperiods of depression that happen along with symptoms of mania, or\\nperiods of mania that happen along with symptoms of depression\\nAutism. Abilify is used to treat irritability related to autism spectrum disorder in children ages 6 years and older. Autism is a mental health condition. It may affect how you think, act, and feel. Autism can also cause behavior changes, such as irritability. Abilify is used to treat the episodes of irritability that can happen with this condition. Autism can cause a wide variety of symptoms, though. For example, with autism you may have trouble:\\nexpressing how you feel or what you need\\nadapting to new routines\\nrelating to others\\nmaking eye contact\\nSchizophrenia. Abilify is used to treat schizophrenia in adults and children ages 13 years and older. With schizophrenia, you have two or more of the following symptoms for at least 1 month:\\nhallucinations (hearing or seeing things that aren’t really there)\\ndelusions (belief in things that aren’t real)\\nloss of focus\\nextremely disorganized behavior, such as being agitated or unable to coordinate your muscle movements\\nloss of interest in work, school, or other activities\\nTourette syndrome. Abilify is used to treat Tourette syndrome in children ages 6 years and older. Tourette syndrome causes involuntary and repetitive movements. With Tourette syndrome, you may also make involuntary sounds that you aren’t able to control. For example, you may stick out your tongue or blink your eyes.

Conditions that can increase your risk of heart disease include:\\nhigh blood pressure\\nhigh cholesterol\\nsmoking\\nbeing of older age\\nType 2 diabetes is a condition that causes high blood sugar. Blood sugar is the primary source of energy for cells in your body. To help sugar get from your blood into your cells, the pancreas releases a hormone called insulin.\\nBut with type 2 diabetes, your body can’t effectively use the insulin it makes. Over time, this can cause too much sugar to stay in the blood. And a high level of blood sugar over a long period of time can cause serious problems, including heart disease.\\nTrulicity works to lower blood sugar levels by attaching to certain receptors (attachment sites) on the cells of your pancreas. These cells tell your pancreas to release insulin. By attaching to the cells, Trulicity helps your pancreas release more insulin, which lowers your blood sugar.',\n",

This complete treatment program helps to increase long-term success with treatment.\\nOpioids are a group of medications used to manage moderate to severe pain. But with long-term use, they may cause drug dependence and addiction. (With dependence, your body needs a drug in order for you to feel normal. And with addiction, a drug is taken, even if it’s causing harmful outcomes.)\\nZubsolv is a partial agonist-antagonist drug. This means it provides some similar effects as opioids and it also blocks the effects of opioids.\\nZubsolv contains these two drugs, which help manage opioid dependence symptoms:\\nBuprenorphine, which is a weak opioid. It works to reduce your opioid cravings and lower your risk for opioid withdrawal symptoms after you stop taking opioids.\\nNaloxone, which is an opioid antagonist.

It’s a prescription drug that comes in three different forms. And depending on the form of buprenorphine prescribed, it may be used to treat opioid dependence or manage moderate to severe pain.\\nThese uses are described in more detail below.\\nBuprenorphine for pain (injection and patches)\\nBuprenorphine injection and patches may be used to treat moderate to severe pain. For this use, buprenorphine injection can be given to adults and children ages 12 years and older. But buprenorphine patches can only be given to adults.\\nIn this case, buprenorphine is only used for pain that requires treatment with an opioid (strong pain medications). And it’s prescribed only if other pain treatments haven’t worked.\\nBuprenorphine injections are used for short-term pain relief. Typically, they’re given for pain management after a surgery or other medical procedure. Buprenorphine patches, on the other hand, are used for long-term pain relief. They’re typically given to manage pain that’s caused by long lasting conditions, such as cancer.\\nBuprenorphine works by binding to certain receptors (attachment sites) in your brain. These receptors are responsible for sending pain signals in your body. By binding to these receptors, buprenorphine blocks pain signals from being sent to the rest of your body.\\nBuprenorphine is a type of opioid called a partial opioid agonist. For pain management, it works differently from full agonist opioids. (Examples of full agonist opioids include morphine and codeine.) This is because buprenorphine has a limit (ceiling) on its effects. Higher doses of this drug don’t provide greater pain relief. And higher doses may lead to increased side effects of the drug.\\nBuprenorphine for opioid dependence (tablets)\\nBuprenorphine tablets are used in adults to treat opioid dependence, which is now called opioid use disorder (OUD). Opioids are strong pain medications. With dependence, your body needs a drug for you to feel as you usually would. With OUD, opioids are taken long term in a way other than how they’re prescribed.\\nSpecifically, buprenorphine is used for the beginning phase of treatment for opioid dependence. It’s used to manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms in people with opioid dependence who’ve stopped taking opioids. It’s given as part of a complete treatment program along with counseling and suggested lifestyle changes.\\nIf you suddenly stop taking opioids when your body is dependent on them, you can have strong cravings for opioids. You can also have withdrawal symptoms from opioids. Possible opioid withdrawal symptoms include:\\nbody aches\\nanxiety\\nirritability\\npoor sleep\\nsweating\\nBuprenorphine helps you function better without having withdrawal symptoms and cravings when you stop taking other opioids.

            "       'What is losartan used for?\\nIf you have heart problems or diabetes, your doctor may prescribe losartan for you. It’s a blood pressure medicine. But it’s used for other conditions, too.\\nSpecifically, losartan is used for the following purposes:\\nTreat high blood pressure. To treat high blood pressure, losartan is used in adults and children ages 6 years and older. Blood pressure describes the force of blood pushing against the walls of your blood vessels. High blood pressure happens when this force is higher than usual.\\nLower the risk of stroke. To lower the risk of stroke, losartan is used in adults* with high blood pressure and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). LVH causes an increase in the thickness of the muscles in the left ventricle of the heart. People with LVH have a higher risk for stroke because their heart doesn’t pump blood effectively.\\nTreat diabetic nephropathy (DN). Losartan is used in adults to treat DN. DN is a type of kidney disease that occurs in people with diabetes. For this use, adults must have all of the following conditions:\\nType 2 diabetes. With type 2 diabetes, your blood sugar level is higher than usual.\\nHigh blood pressure, either currently or in the past.\\nHigh level of creatinine in their blood. Creatinine is a substance that forms in the body when muscles break down naturally. A high creatinine level usually means your kidneys aren’t working correctly.\\nHigh level of protein in their urine. This usually means the kidneys aren’t working correctly.\\nLosartan works by blocking a hormone in your body called angiotensin. By blocking this hormone, losartan lowers your blood pressure and helps your kidneys work correctly.\\nFor more information, see “How does losartan work?” in the “What are some frequently asked questions about losartan?” section above.\\n* Your race may affect how your body responds to losartan. For more information, talk with your doctor. They can tell you whether losartan is right for you.',\n",

            "       'What is the Fasenra injection used for?\\nFasenra is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adults and in children ages 12 years and older.\\nEosinophilic asthma results from a high level of white blood cells called eosinophils. These cells are part of your immune system. But with this condition, the cells mistakenly attack your body’s airways. This leads to swelling and damage, causing symptoms such as:\\ncoughing\\nshortness of breath\\nchest tightness\\ntrouble breathing\\nnasal polyps\\nrunny or stuffy nose and a reduced sense of smell\\nSymptoms typically worsen with higher levels of eosinophils in the body.\\nFasenra works by attaching to eosinophils.

This lowers the level of eosinophils in your body, helping to relieve symptoms.\\nNote: Fasenra should not be used to treat other conditions caused by a high level of eosinophils. And it should not be used to treat an asthma attack (sudden worsening of asthma symptoms).

These are sudden muscle spasms that you can’t control. Affected muscles may feel tight, hard, or painful. Most people who took Nexlizet in studies didn’t have this side effect. But some people had to stop the drug because of severe muscle cramps, though this was rare.\\nWhat might help\\nMuscle cramps usually go away on their own within a few seconds to minutes. Here are a few tips to try when a muscle cramp occurs:\\nStretch the affected area of your body.\\nGently massage the tight or painful area.\\nMove around. For example, if a leg cramp occurs while you’re in bed, it can help to get up and walk around.\\nStaying hydrated may also help prevent muscle cramps. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids each day, especially if you’re exercising in hot weather.\\nTalk with your doctor if muscle cramps become severe while you’re taking Nexlizet. They may recommend a different treatment option for your condition.\\nBelly pain\\nSome people may have belly pain while taking Nexlizet. While most people taking the drug in studies didn’t have this side effect, some reported pain or discomfort in their upper or lower abdomen.\\nWhat might help\\nIf you have belly pain while taking Nexlizet, it should go away with continued treatment. Some people find that taking the drug with food helps prevent or lessen this side effect. (Nexlizet may be taken with or without food.)\\nIf this side effect doesn’t go away or becomes severe, tell your doctor. They may want to check you for other causes of belly pain. Or they may prescribe a different cholesterol-lowering drug for you instead of Nexlizet.\\nTendon problems\\nNexlizet contains the active ingredient bempedoic acid. This ingredient may increase the risk of tendon problems. (Tendons are connective tissues that attach muscles to bones.)\\nPain or swelling may occur if tendons rupture, tear, or become inflamed.

But it occurred rarely in studies that just looked at bempedoic acid, one of the active drugs in Nexlizet. (An active ingredient is what makes a drug work.)\\nWhat might help\\nBefore starting Nexlizet, be sure to tell your doctor if any of the factors above apply to you. They may prescribe a different treatment for high cholesterol that doesn’t contain bempedoic acid. Or if you need to take a short course of a steroid or fluoroquinolone antibiotic, they may have you pause Nexlizet treatment temporarily.\\nIf you develop pain or swelling anywhere in your body, rest the affected area and tell your doctor right away. They’ll help you identify the cause of your symptoms. If they confirm you have a tendon injury, they’ll likely have you stop taking Nexlizet.\\nALLERGIC REACTION\\nSome people may have an allergic reaction to Nexlizet.

It’s not known how common weight gain was in NovoLog’s studies.\\nWeight gain is a side effect of all insulins, and it’s related to how insulin works in your body.\\nAll insulins (including NovoLog) remove excess sugar from your blood. Some of this sugar is used by your body’s cells for energy. But some sugar gets stored as fat to be used for energy later. This can lead to weight gain over time.\\nWhat might help\\nIf you’re concerned about weight gain during your NovoLog treatment, talk with your doctor.\\nIf you use NovoLog and also take a type of diabetes drug called a thiazolidinedione, you should call your doctor right away if you suddenly gain a lot of weight (such as 5 pounds overnight). Sudden weight gain can be a symptom of heart failure. In rare cases, taking NovoLog and thiazolidinedione drugs together can lead to heart failure.\\nLow blood sugar\\nAs with all medications used to treat diabetes, NovoLog can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is the most common side effect caused by drugs that contain insulin, including NovoLog. (The active drug in NovoLog is insulin aspart.) In most cases, this side effect is mild.\\nSymptoms of mild hypoglycemia can include:\\nweakness\\nconfusion\\nhunger\\nfeeling dizzy or jittery\\nheadache\\nIn rare cases, NovoLog can cause severe hypoglycemia (extremely low blood sugar). Your risk of severe hypoglycemia from NovoLog may be higher if you:\\nare fasting\\ntake other diabetes drugs with Novolog\\nhave kidney or liver problems\\nSymptoms of severe hypoglycemia may include:\\ntrouble concentrating\\nslurred speech\\nblurred vision\\nSevere hypoglycemia is a medical emergency that requires help from another person. If not treated quickly, it can lead to fainting, coma, seizures, or even death. If you have symptoms of severe hypoglycemia, you or someone around you should call 911 or your local emergency number. Or you should go to the nearest emergency room.\\nIf you’re concerned about your risk of severe hypoglycemia with NovoLog, talk with your doctor.\\nWhat might help\\nBefore you begin taking NovoLog, talk with your doctor about checking your blood sugar during your treatment. Your doctor will let you know how often you’ll need to do this.\\nYou should also talk with your doctor about what to do if you experience hypoglycemia during your NovoLog treatment. In many cases, mild hypoglycemia can be treated at home using fast-acting carbohydrates, such as:\\nglucose (sugar) tablets\\n1 tablespoon of honey\\n½ cup of juice or regular (non-diet) soda\\nthree or four pieces of hard candy\\nYour doctor may also prescribe glucagon (GlucaGen) for you, which is a medication used to quickly raise blood sugar levels that are severely low. If your doctor prescribes glucagon for you, they’ll tell you more about the dosage and how it’s used.\\nBefore starting treatment with NovoLog, talk with your doctor about your treatment plan in case you have hypoglycemia. But if you have symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or symptoms that feel life threatening, you or someone around you should call 911 (or your local emergency number). Or go to the closest emergency room.\\nInjection site reactions\\nYou may have reactions at the injection site after taking a dose of NovoLog. In studies, this was a common side effect in people using NovoLog.\\nInjection-site reactions may include:\\nitchiness\\nskin discoloration\\npain\\nswelling\\nIn some cases, NovoLog injections can also cause lipodystrophy (skin dimpling). With this condition, your skin thickens or forms “pits” at the site where you inject NovoLog.\\nIf NovoLog (or other insulin) is injected into skin areas affected by lipodystrophy, the drug may not work properly. This could lead to your blood sugar becoming too high or too low.\\nWhat might help\\nIt’s recommended that you rotate injection sites each time you use NovoLog. This will lower your risk for injection site reactions and lipodystrophy.\\nYou should also avoid injecting NovoLog anywhere that your skin is:\\nthickened\\npitted or has lumps\\nbruised\\nhard\\nscaly\\ntender\\ndamaged in any way\\nIf you experience lipodystrophy or injection site reactions that are bothersome to you, talk with your doctor. They may recommend other treatment options for your diabetes.\\nALLERGIC REACTION\\nSome people may have an allergic reaction to NovoLog. It’s not known how often these reactions occurred in studies, but they’re thought to be rare.\\nSymptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include:\\nskin rash\\nitchiness\\nflushing (temporary warmth, redness, or deepening of skin color)\\nA more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include swelling under your skin, typically in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet. They can also include swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat, which can cause trouble breathing.\\nCall your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction to NovoLog.

A boxed warning is a serious warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The drug’s boxed warnings are described below.\\nSerious infections. Taking Olumiant increases your risk of serious infections. This is because Olumiant works by reducing the activity of your immune system. Rarely, these infections can be life threatening and require treatment in a hospital. This includes tuberculosis (TB), for example.\\nWhat might help\\nCall your doctor right away if you have symptoms of an infection while taking Olumiant. These include:\\nchills or fever\\ncough\\ncoughing up blood\\ndiarrhea\\nmuscle aches\\nsore throat\\nshortness of breath\\nYour doctor will test you for TB and other infections before you start taking Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or alopecia areata. You should not start this drug if you have an active infection. If you have an infection, it will need to be treated before it’s safe for you to take Olumiant.\\nBlood clots. Rarely, taking Olumiant can cause blood clots, such as:\\ndeep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a blood clot that usually forms in your leg\\npulmonary embolism (PE), which is a blood clot in your lung\\nWhat might help\\nCall your doctor right away or seek medical help if you have symptoms of a blood clot while you’re taking Olumiant. These symptoms include:\\ntrouble breathing\\npain, tenderness, redness or discoloration, warmth, or swelling in one leg\\nsudden chest pain\\nCancer. Olumiant reduces the activity of your immune system. This can increase your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including non-melanoma skin cancer and lymphoma.\\nCancer doesn’t always cause symptoms. But if you notice any of the following, call your doctor right away:\\nchanges in your skin, such as new or changing moles, patches, or growths\\nskin sores that don’t heal or go away\\nswelling in your lymph nodes, such as in your armpit, groin, or neck\\nunexplained weight loss\\nWhat might help\\nBe sure to tell your doctor if you’ve ever had cancer before starting Olumiant. They may decide that a different treatment is safer for your condition.\\nSerious heart-related events. Recent studies looked at Xeljanz, which is another drug used to treat RA. These studies showed that the drug increased people’s risk of serious heart-related events, including heart attack and stroke.\\nThis risk hasn’t been reported with Olumiant. But because it works in the same way as Xeljanz, Olumiant could also increase this risk, in theory. Because of this, the FDA has applied a boxed warning\\nto Olumiant for serious heart-related events as well.\\nIf you already have risk factors for heart-related events, you may have an increased risk of these if you take Olumiant.\\nWhat might help\\nTalk with your doctor to see if you have risk factors for heart-related events.

Doing so may increase your risk for dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms from alprazolam IR oral tablets can be mild or serious, and can include:\\nblurred vision\\ndiarrhea\\ntrouble concentrating\\ninsomnia (trouble sleeping)\\nmuscle cramps or twitches\\nseizures\\nIn addition, anxiety or symptoms of anxiety may occur if you stop alprazolam. It’s not known whether this is due to withdrawal or to symptoms of your condition getting worse after stopping the medication.\\nFor this reason, it’s important that you do not stop taking alprazolam unless your doctor specifically advises you to do so. You also should not change your dosage or take the medication in a way that’s different from your doctor’s instructions. Missing doses of alprazolam can also cause withdrawal symptoms.\\nIf you and your doctor agree that you should stop taking alprazolam, your doctor will suggest a way to taper your dosage. (Tapering means slowly decreasing the dosage over time.) This helps lower your risk for withdrawal symptoms from alprazolam.\\nRisk of misuse and addiction. Taking controlled substances such as alprazolam may lead to misuse and addiction. Misuse means a drug is taken in a way other than how it’s prescribed. And addiction is when a drug is taken even if it’s causing harmful effects.\\nWhat might help\\nTell your doctor if you have a history of misuse or addiction. Your doctor may monitor you for these risks during alprazolam treatment. They may also recommend another treatment option that’s better suited to you.\\nFor more information about misuse of alprazolam, refer to the “Can alprazolam IR oral tablet be misused?” section below.\\nRisks when taken with opioids. Taking a benzodiazepine such as alprazolam with opioids can increase your risk for severe side effects, including:\\nextreme sleepiness or inability to stay awake\\nrespiratory depression (severe trouble with breathing)\\ncoma\\nin rare cases, death\\nWhat might help\\nYou should take alprazolam IR oral tablets with an opioid only if your doctor agrees that this is the best treatment plan for you. For both drugs, your doctor will prescribe the lowest dose needed to treat your condition for the shortest time possible.\\nBefore you take alprazolam, be sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist about all the medications you take. They can check for any drug interactions with alprazolam. (With drug interactions, taking medications with a certain drug affects how the drug works.)\\nYour doctor may prescribe a lower dosage of alprazolam if you take an opioid. Or they may prescribe a different medication.\\nIf you’re prescribed an opioid while you’re taking alprazolam, be sure your doctor knows you’re taking alprazolam. You may need a lower dose of the opioid medication. Or your doctor may decide to lower your dose of alprazolam. They may also prescribe something for your pain other than an opioid.\\nFor a list of opioids, see “Interactions” in the “What should be considered before taking alprazolam IR oral tablet?” section below.\\nSide effects in older people\\nOlder people may be at higher risk for side effects if they take alprazolam. This is because the way our kidneys handle certain medications, including alprazolam, changes as we age.\\nAs a result, alprazolam levels may build up in older people, even at approved doses. This puts older people at higher risk for side effects from alprazolam, including sleepiness and problems with coordination or balance.\\nWhat might help\\nYour doctor will prescribe the lowest dosage of alprazolam that works for you. This helps lower the risk of side effects.\\nTalk with your doctor if you’re concerned about side effects from alprazolam, or if you’re having side effects while taking it.\\nWeight gain or weight loss\\nTaking alprazolam IR oral tablets could cause weight gain or weight loss. People taking the drug in clinical trials reported weight changes.\\nIt’s also important to note that weight changes can be symptoms of an anxiety disorder.\\nWeight loss can also be a symptom of withdrawal from alprazolam. The drug has a boxed warning\\nfor the risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Boxed warnings are serious warnings from the FDA.\\nFor more information about withdrawal and alprazolam, see the “Boxed warnings” section above.\\nWhat might help\\nIf you’re concerned about your weight while taking alprazolam IR oral tablets, talk with your doctor. They can recommend ways to maintain a weight that is healthy for you. They may also suggest stopping alprazolam treatment and trying a different medication for your condition.\\nALLERGIC REACTION\\nSome people may have an allergic reaction to alprazolam IR oral tablets.\\nSymptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include:\\nskin rash\\nitchiness\\nflushing (temporary warmth, redness, or deepening of skin color)\\nA more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include swelling under your skin, typically in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet. They can also include swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat, which can cause trouble breathing.\\nCall your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction to alprazolam IR oral tablets. But if you think you’re having a medical emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number.',\n",

              "        'What is Sunosi used for?\\nSunosi is used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness related to narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea in adults.\\nWhat is narcolepsy?\\nNarcolepsy is a condition that causes abnormal sleep. This can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and “sleep attacks” (an overwhelming urge to fall asleep).\\nSymptoms of narcolepsy can include:\\nsignificant daytime sleepiness\\ncataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone that’s temporary)\\nsleep paralysis\\ntrouble falling or staying asleep\\nWhat is obstructive sleep apnea?\\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by narrowing of the airways during sleep, which cuts off breathing. This causes poor sleep quality, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness.\\nSymptoms of OSA can include:\\nloud snoring\\ngasping, choking, or snorting during sleep\\nmorning headache\\nwaking repeatedly during the night\\nforgetfulness\\nNote: Sunosi is not used to treat the airway obstruction that causes OSA. Before taking Sunosi, people with OSA should receive airway obstruction treatment for at least 1 month. An example of this kind of treatment is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Treatment for airway obstruction should continue while taking Sunosi.\\nHow Sunosi works\\nSunosi is a kind of drug called a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. This means it blocks the hormones dopamine and norepinephrine from being stored in the brain. Sunosi’s mechanism of action (the way a drug works) for treating excessive daytime sleepiness isn’t fully understood. But it’s believed that it helps improve wakefulness and energy by increasing the levels of these hormones in the body.',\n",
              "        'What is Sunosi’s dosage?\\nYour doctor will recommend the dosage of Sunosi that’s right for you. Below are commonly prescribed dosages, but always take the dosage your doctor prescribes.\\nForm\\nSunosi comes as a tablet that you swallow.\\nRecommended Sunosi dosing\\nYou’ll take Sunosi once per day. It’s recommended that you take it as soon as you wake up.\\nQuestions about Sunosi’s dosage\\nBelow are some common questions about Sunosi’s dosage.\\nWhat if I miss a dose of Sunosi? If you miss a dose of Sunosi, just skip the missed dose. Taking Sunosi too late in your day could cause difficulty sleeping. Take your next dose the next day as usual. Do not take more than one dose of Sunosi to make up for a missed dose.\\nWill I need to take Sunosi long term? If you and your doctor agree that Sunosi is safe and effective for you, you’ll likely take the medication long term.\\nHow long does it take for Sunosi to work? Sunosi begins working as soon as you take a dose. In studies, people saw their symptoms easing within the first week of taking the drug.',\n",
              "        'What are Sunosi’s side effects?\\nLike most drugs, Sunosi may cause mild or serious side effects. The lists below describe some of the more common side effects that Sunosi may cause. These lists don’t include all possible side effects.\\nKeep in mind that side effects of a drug can depend on:\\nyour age\\nother health conditions you have\\nother medications you take\\nYour doctor or pharmacist can tell you more about the potential side effects of Sunosi. They can also suggest ways to help reduce side effects.\\nMild side effects\\nHere’s a short list of some of the mild side effects that Sunosi can cause. To learn about other mild side effects of the drug, talk with your doctor or pharmacist, or read Sunosi’s prescribing information.\\nMild side effects of Sunosi that have been reported include:\\nheadache\\nnausea\\nappetite loss\\ntrouble sleeping\\ndry mouth\\nconstipation\\nfeeling like your heart is pounding or racing\\ndiarrhea\\nsweating more than usual\\nMild side effects of many drugs may go away within a few days to a couple of weeks. But if they become bothersome, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.\\nSerious side effects\\nSerious side effects from Sunosi can occur, but they aren’t common. If you have serious side effects from Sunosi, call your doctor right away. But if you think you’re having a medical emergency, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number.\\nSerious side effects of Sunosi that have been reported include:\\nhigh blood pressure\\nincreased heart rate\\nanxiety or irritability\\nallergic reaction*\\n* To learn more about this side effect, see the “Allergic reaction” section below.\\nALLERGIC REACTION\\nSome people may have an allergic reaction to Sunosi. While allergic reactions weren’t reported in studies of the drug, they have happened since the drug became available on the market.\\nSymptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include:\\nskin rash\\nitchiness\\nflushing (temporary warmth, discoloration, or deepening of skin color)\\nA more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include swelling under your skin, usually in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet. They can also include swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat, which can cause trouble breathing.\\nCall your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction to Sunosi. But if you think you’re having a medical emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number.']],\n",

This can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and “sleep attacks” (an overwhelming urge to fall asleep).\\nSymptoms of narcolepsy can include:\\nsignificant daytime sleepiness\\ncataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone that’s temporary)\\nsleep paralysis\\ntrouble falling or staying asleep\\nWhat is obstructive sleep apnea?\\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by narrowing of the airways during sleep, which cuts off breathing. This causes poor sleep quality, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness.\\nSymptoms of OSA can include:\\nloud snoring\\ngasping, choking, or snorting during sleep\\nmorning headache\\nwaking repeatedly during the night\\nforgetfulness\\nNote: Sunosi is not used to treat the airway obstruction that causes OSA. Before taking Sunosi, people with OSA should receive airway obstruction treatment for at least 1 month. An example of this kind of treatment is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Treatment for airway obstruction should continue while taking Sunosi.\\nHow Sunosi works\\nSunosi is a kind of drug called a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. This means it blocks the hormones dopamine and norepinephrine from being stored in the brain. Sunosi’s mechanism of action (the way a drug works) for treating excessive daytime sleepiness isn’t fully understood. But it’s believed that it helps improve wakefulness and energy by increasing the levels of these hormones in the body.',\n",
              "        'What is Sunosi’s dosage?\\nYour doctor will recommend the dosage of Sunosi that’s right for you. Below are commonly prescribed dosages, but always take the dosage your doctor prescribes.\\nForm\\nSunosi comes as a tablet that you swallow.\\nRecommended Sunosi dosing\\nYou’ll take Sunosi once per day. It’s recommended that you take it as soon as you wake up.\\nQuestions about Sunosi’s dosage\\nBelow are some common questions about Sunosi’s dosage.\\nWhat if I miss a dose of Sunosi? If you miss a dose of Sunosi, just skip the missed dose. Taking Sunosi too late in your day could cause difficulty sleeping. Take your next dose the next day as usual. Do not take more than one dose of Sunosi to make up for a missed dose.\\nWill I need to take Sunosi long term? If you and your doctor agree that Sunosi is safe and effective for you, you’ll likely take the medication long term.\\nHow long does it take for Sunosi to work? Sunosi begins working as soon as you take a dose. In studies, people saw their symptoms easing within the first week of taking the drug.',\n",
              "        'What are Sunosi’s side effects?\\nLike most drugs, Sunosi may cause mild or serious side effects. The lists below describe some of the more common side effects that Sunosi may cause. These lists don’t include all possible side effects.\\nKeep in mind that side effects of a drug can depend on:\\nyour age\\nother health conditions you have\\nother medications you take\\nYour doctor or pharmacist can tell you more about the potential side effects of Sunosi. They can also suggest ways to help reduce side effects.\\nMild side effects\\nHere’s a short list of some of the mild side effects that Sunosi can cause. To learn about other mild side effects of the drug, talk with your doctor or pharmacist, or read Sunosi’s prescribing information.\\nMild side effects of Sunosi that have been reported include:\\nheadache\\nnausea\\nappetite loss\\ntrouble sleeping\\ndry mouth\\nconstipation\\nfeeling like your heart is pounding or racing\\ndiarrhea\\nsweating more than usual\\nMild side effects of many drugs may go away within a few days to a couple of weeks. But if they become bothersome, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.\\nSerious side effects\\nSerious side effects from Sunosi can occur, but they aren’t common. If you have serious side effects from Sunosi, call your doctor right away. But if you think you’re having a medical emergency, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number.\\nSerious side effects of Sunosi that have been reported include:\\nhigh blood pressure\\nincreased heart rate\\nanxiety or irritability\\nallergic reaction*\\n* To learn more about this side effect, see the “Allergic reaction” section below.\\nALLERGIC REACTION\\nSome people may have an allergic reaction to Sunosi. While allergic reactions weren’t reported in studies of the drug, they have happened since the drug became available on the market.\\nSymptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include:\\nskin rash\\nitchiness\\nflushing (temporary warmth, discoloration, or deepening of skin color)\\nA more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include swelling under your skin, usually in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet. They can also include swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat, which can cause trouble breathing.\\nCall your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction to Sunosi. But if you think you’re having a medical emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number.']],\n",
